# AI Models for COVID-19 Forecasting

This repository contains Python implementations for:
- ARIMA
- LSTM
- Hybrid ARIMA-LSTM

These models were used to forecast daily new COVID-19 cases in Malaysia. The implementation includes model training, evaluation, and rolling forecasting.

## 📁 Files

- `ARIMA_Model.py`: Forecasting using ARIMA
- `LSTM_Model.py`: Forecasting using LSTM
- `Hybrid_ARIMA_LSTM_Model.py`: Combined ARIMA and LSTM model
- `requirements.txt`: Python libraries needed

> Note: Dataset file `RESEARCH DATA.xlsx` is not included in this repository. Please contact the author for access.

## 🛠 Requirements

Python 3.8 or higher

Install required libraries with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 Running the Code

Make sure `RESEARCH DATA.xlsx` is in the same folder as the scripts, then run for example:

```bash
python ARIMA_Model.py
```
